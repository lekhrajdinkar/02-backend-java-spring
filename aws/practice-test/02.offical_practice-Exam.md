- When Amazon ECS uses Fargate for compute, it `incurs minimal costs` when the application is `idle`. 
- Aurora Serverless also incurs no compute costs when it is `idle`.
- Data transfer to CloudFront is free of cost.
- data transfer from CloudFront to an on-premises location incurs a cost.
- S3 is cheaper for general storage, especially for large, infrequently accessed data.
- EFS is more expensive but better suited for workloads requiring shared file storage and lower latency
