# EC2 / IaaS
- EC2_01: https://chatgpt.com/c/7ddee1bf-7240-4789-913a-72dae8438d00
- EC2_02 : https://chatgpt.com/c/636011e3-1ce6-4268-8089-47ca3b12c9b9
--- 
- SSH (ec2-linux,mac,W10+) vs  Putty (ec2-W7,8,9) 
- `EC2 instance Connect` (ec2-any instance) : browser session.
- aws cli installed in ec2.
- ** don't run aws configure on ec2 instances.
- rather, attach IAM role to EC2 instance.

## Instance type: https://ec2instances.github.io/ [family,version].[size]
- `general purpose` : balanced, eg: t2.micro
- `compute` optimized, c** : gaming server, batch, ML
- `memory` optimized, r**, X** : real-time system, large dataset processing, BI
- `storage` optimized, D**, H1, I3 : File System, data-ware house, cache server, OLTP etc
---
- purchase options:
  - On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second (W and Linux) hour (other OS)
  - `Reserved` (1 & 3 years)
    - Reserved Instances, 72% – long workloads, fixed instance type,OS.
    - `Convertible` Reserved Instances, 66% – long workloads with flexible instances types
  - `Savings` Plans (1 & 3 years) – `commitment` to an amount of usage. Flexible : switch OS, inst type.
  - `Spot Instances` 90% – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable), 
    - 2min grace period.
    - spot-block  (1-6 hr), no interruption.
    - Stop request and terminate instance manually then.
    - one time vs persistent.
    - maximun price
  - `Spot fleet` : Spot Instances + optional(On demand)
  - `Dedicated Instances` 
    - no other customers will share your hardware. 
    - VM but underlying h/w not shared with other account.
  - `Dedicated Hosts`
    - most expensive 
    - book an entire physical server/racks/building. 
    - control over instance `placement`
    - pay by : physical cores and underlying network socket visibility.

> `hibernate` : 
>   - whatever in RAM state (< 150 GB), preserved in EBS root volume. hence bootup fast. 
>   - supported by : C**, M** and T** family instances.
>   - max for 60 days

## EC2 : 
- `Tenancy` : host, Dedicated, default
- `SSH` key-Pair
- os/`AMI`, 
- memory 
- cpu arch : `ARM or AMD`
- storage : `EBS`, `EFS`, `Instant Store`
- `user-data script` / bootstap  - (install, update,etc task)
- `Placement group`:
  - `cluster` : same AZ, close-proximity. hence high n/w througput
  - `spread` : different AZ, max 7 instance in each AZ.
  - `partition` : partition/racks in different AZ, max 100
- Networking things :
  - Attach `ENI` (virtual `network-card`) , bound to AZ.
    - speed, eg 10Gbps
    - `VPC` and subnet
    - one IP public + one MAC address.
    - one private (primary) + many secondary private IP
    - `SG` / virtual firewalls / traffic rules(60 max) - eg: allow incoming http, SSH traffic.
      - inbound: all traffic blocked by default.
      - outbound : all traffic allow by default
    - `elastic-IP` vs  ( random Public IP + DNS ) better vs ELB/LB
    - ** network failover :: if ec2-1 is down >> then launch ec2-2 and attach ENI from old instance to new.
  - `ELB`
  - `ASG`
---
## Security Group / SG  more
- `M2M` : apply multiple(max 5) sg on an ec2 instance, apply same sg2 to multipe ec2 insatnces.
  - EC2 instance-1 has sg-1, sg2,etc
  - EC2 instance-2 has sg-1, sg3,etc
- `region` specific ( sg + region combination )
- outside EC2
- `Stateful`
- always create new SG for `SSH` (22) 
  - ssh -i "path/to/your-key-file.pem" -p 22 ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns
  - use keypair over password
---
- inbound RULES:
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, RDP etc)
  - `Source IP range/CIDR`
    - 203.0.113.1/32 (specfic IP)
    - 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
  - `target port` / single or range (target machine which is ec2)
    - classic port: 21,22,80,443, 3389
    - ICMP (Ping)  doesn't use ports
---
- outbound RULES:
  - Protocol
  - destination IP
  - source port
