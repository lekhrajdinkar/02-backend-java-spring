# VPC 3

## Network ACL ( NACLs )
- Network - Access control lst
- similar to SG/Firewall, another layer of traffic check at `subnet level`
- `stateless` :  
  - inbound rule is checked > req allowed > response came > outbound rule is checked.
  - return traffic is automatically allowed

- ACL : rules
  - 1-32766 (high to low precedence), use increment of 100.
  - first matching rule, dreive decision.
  - `*` last rule, denies a request.
- default NACL:
  - allows everything in/out.
  - don't change it, rather create new ACL and assiciate with your subnet.
    - subnet <--1 to 1--> ACL

- sg vs ACL
  - Operates at the instance level | subnet level
  - Stateful| Stateless: return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules (think of ephemeral ports)
  - `allow` rules only |  `allow/deny` rules
  - `All` rules are evaluated | Rules are evaluated `in order` (lowest to highest) and `first match wins`.
