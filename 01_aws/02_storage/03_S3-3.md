# S3-ACL (Access control list)
- **different** from NACL/network-ACL

- Purpose: Controls access to individual S3 buckets and objects.
- Usage: Defines which `AWS accounts` or `groups` have access to specific S3 resources 
  - Can be applied at the **bucket level** or **object level**. check eg below
  - permission - READ, WRITE, FULL_CONTROL, etc.
  - can also specify whether it is **publicly readable**
    - so use carefully.

## terraform
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "example_object" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket.id
  key    = "example.txt"
  source = "example.txt"  # Path to the local file
  acl    = "private"      # Setting ACL at the object level                 <<<<
  tags = {
    Name = "example-object"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"  # This sets the bucket to be publicly readable.  <<<<
  tags = {
    Name        = "example-bucket"
    Environment = "development"
  }
}

```
- acl value: 
  - `private`: Owner has full control. (default)
  - `public-read`: Owner has full control, and the bucket or object is readable by the public.
  - `public-read-write`: Owner has full control, and the bucket or object is publicly readable and writable.
  - `authenticated-read`: Owner has full control, and any authenticated AWS user can read.
  - `bucket-owner-read`: Bucket owner has read access.
  - `bucket-owner-full-control`: Bucket owner has full control.
  - `log-delivery-write`: Permissions are granted for the bucket to write logs (used for server)
  - **custom ACL**
    - write json policy:
    - this specific JSON format cannot be directly used with the `acl` argument in Terraform, it can be incorporated through a `bucket policy` instead
