# VPC-2

## 1. access ec2-i in private subnet
### 1.1. bastion host : SSH 
- access ec2-i in private subnet from  [ public-subnet(has routing to igw-1) > `bastion ec2-instance` ]
- just update SGs:
  - sg-bastion : inbound : source:MyPublicIP, to port 22(SSH) --> so that I can SSh from my laptop
  - sg-ec2-i : inbound : CUSTOM >> source:sg-bastion, to port 22(SSH) **

    - demo:
      - my-laptop/client  -> ssh to bastion (running inside public-subnet)
      - In bastion, add `keypair` for private ec2-i.
      - From bastion,  SSH to private ec2
      
- bastion host is not typically used to manage all` outgoing traffic` from the private network to the internet.

### 1.2. NAT instance : https / http
- > outdated,after 2020 : use NAT-gateway 
- internet access:
  - `incoming` : internet:(abc.com/Mylaptop) --> http/SSH -->  ec2-i1 (private subnet)
  - `outgoing` : ec2-i1 (private subnet) --> https --> abc.com **
  - how:
    - having routing through NAT-instance ( deployed/running in VPC-1's public subnet) :
    - internet <---> ` NAT-intance (public subnet)` <--->  ec2-i1 (private subnet)
    - `update rtb` of private subnet:
      - 0.0.0.0/0  ::  NAT-instance
      - above entry will forward  `internet-requests traffic` to `NAT-instance`
    - can manage its sg.
    - test internet:
      - outgoing : go to ec2-i1 terminal > ping abc.com
      - incoming : ...
      
- support `port forwarding` by modifying the instance's `iptables` rules.
  - Modify the iptables rules to forward traffic from a specific port on the NAT Instance to a port on a private EC2 instance.
  
- provision NAT-instance :
  - create ec2-i, from PreConfigured Linux AMI, `amzn-ami-vpc-nat-<year>.xxxxxxx-<cpu-arch>`
  - assign `elastic-IP`
  - disable : `source/destination IP check`, so that it will re-write `src` and `dest` IPs.
  - update `rtb` as shown above.
  - Also, `update sg of your private ec2-i`, to allow incoming traffic:
  - ```
    - inbound ( allow restricted traffic) : 
      - SSH,   source: Anywhere
      - HTTP,  source: VPC-CIDR - web
      - HTTPs, source: VPC-CIDR - web
      - ICMP,  source: VPC-CIDR - for `ping` request.
    - outbound : default : all outgoing allowed.
    ```

### 1.3. NAT Gateway (AZ)
- what if Nat instance is terminated ? `better and easy` solution : NAT gateway
  - AWS-managed 
  - higher bandwidth (100 Gbps)
  - high availability (multi-az)
  - `no administration` : No Security Groups to manage. 
  
- create one with `in each AZ`
  - assign elastic-IP
  - choose public subnet
- update route table of each private subnet.
  - if destination is `0.0.0.0/0`  ::  then route to `NAT-gateway-az-1`
  - if destination is `0.0.0.0/0`  ::  then route to `NAT-gateway-az-2`
- NAT Gateways are primarily for `outbound-only traffic` from private subnets
- no sg.
- **condition**
  - > Canâ€™t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet, where NAT gateway is present
  - Requires an `IGW` on your VPC.
