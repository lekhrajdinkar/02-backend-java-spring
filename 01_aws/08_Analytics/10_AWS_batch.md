# AWS Batch
- fully managed service 
- that efficiently runs batch computing workloads

## Key Features:
- Compute Environment Management: 
  - **Automatically provisions** 
  - and scales the optimal compute resources (e.g., EC2, Spot Instances).
- `Job Queues` 
  - Submit jobs to queues, 
  - and AWS Batch schedules them based on resource availability and priorities.
- `Job Definitions`
  - Define how to run a batch job, 
  - including the Docker container image, vCPUs, memory, and other parameters.

## Use Cases:
- High-performance computing (HPC)
- Data processing
- Large-scale simulations

## Cost-Efficient: 
- Integrates with Spot Instances for lower-cost compute resources.
