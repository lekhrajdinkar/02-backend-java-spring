- OAuth2 : https://dev-16206041-admin.okta.com/admin/apps/active

## Application types and Flow
- handle this on 3 type on architecture/flows:
    - server-side web applications (SpringMVC, JSP) :
    - browser-based applications / SPA :
    - native/mobile apps :
    - connected devices (M2M) :
  
---
## OpenIdConnect
- Token based Authentication.  `ID-Token`
- extension over OAuth2.

##  OAuth2
- https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2
- Definition : OAuth standard protocol to solve `Delegated Authorization`.
    > - allow appl(Client) to access resources hosted by other web apps, on behalf of a user/resource-owner.
    > - provides consented access.
    > - restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources, without sharing user credential.

- Token based Authorization. `Access-Token` + `Refresh Token` (long expiry )
- Token based:
  - format : JWT. 
  - token/s with multiple scope. (roles)
  - received on callback URI
  - OAuth 2.0 doesnâ€™t define a specific format for Access Tokens
- http-redirection (header-`location:url-2`, responseCode - `302`)
- client must identify/authenticate itself, when requesting an Access Token.
- Resource server must validate JWT and has role-based access code.

- Key Components : 
  - user/`resourceOwner`, `Client`, `resource-Server`, `Authorization-Server`.
      - Eg: photoPrint-App <--> Google-Drive
  - `Scopes`
    - specify exactly the `reason`, for which access to resources may be granted.
    - dependent on the Resource Server.
    - while making Auth request mention `scopes`. eg: openid, profile, email, offline_access
    - returned token will have `claims`.
    
  - `Authorization Code`
    - OAuth 2 Authorization server may not directly return an Access Token.
    - Instead, and for better security, an Authorization Code may be returned, which is then exchanged for an Access Token.

###  OAuth2 : Grant Types
- grants are the "set of steps" a Client has to perform to get "resource-access-authorization".

A. `Authorization Code` Grant  with/without PKCE
- After validating client identity,
- AuthServer return single-use Authorization-Code to the Client via callback URI
- which is then exchanged for an Access Token.
- use-case : Traditional web apps where the exchange can `securely` happen on the server side. // back-channel.
- > `PKCE` : additional steps that make it more secure for mobile/native apps and SPAs.
  - ```
    1. Client : GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=`CLIENT_ID`&redirect_uri=`REDIRECT_URI`&scope=read&state=xyz
    2. OKTA : HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client-app.com/callback?code=`AUTHORIZATION_CODE`&state=xyz
    3. Client : POST /token 
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
       grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

B. `Implicit` Grant
- A simplified flow where the Access Token is returned "directly" to the Client.
- use-case : SPA.

C. `client-credential` Grant
- First client acquire its own credentials(client id, client secret) from the Authorization Server,
- Access Token is returned against these credential. (basically AuthServer validate identity.)
- use-case : lambda, micro services.

D. `Refresh Token` Grant
- involves the exchange of a Refresh Token for a new Access Token.
