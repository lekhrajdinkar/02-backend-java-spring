# pre-things
## JWT
- body/payload : claims (statement about user and additional info)

## Application arch
- server-side web applications (SpringMVC, JSP) :
- browser-based applications / SPA :
- native/mobile apps :
- connected devices (M2M, lambda) :

## OpenId Connect
- Token based Authentication.  `ID-Token`
- extension over OAuth2.

# OAuth2
## Intro
- http-redirection (header :: `location=url-2`, responseCode :: `302`)
- refer : https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2
- Definition : OAuth standard protocol to solve `Delegated Authorization`.
    > - allow appl(Client) to access resources hosted by other web apps, on behalf of a user/resource-owner.
    > - provides consented access.
    > - restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources, without sharing user credential.

- Token based Authorization. `Access-Token` + `Refresh Token` (long expiry )
- Token based:
  - format : JWT. 
  - token/s with multiple scope. (roles)
  - received on callback URI
  - OAuth 2.0 doesnâ€™t define a specific format for Access Tokens

- client must identify/authenticate itself, when requesting an Access Token.
- Resource server (spring-backend-app) 
  - must validate JWT 
  - has role-based access code.

## Key Components :
> Eg: photoPrint-App <--> Google-Drive

- **resource-Owner** (User)
- **Client**
- **resource-Server**
- **Authorization-Server**
- more:
  - **Scopes**
    - specify exactly the `reason`, for which access to resources may be granted.
    - dependent on the Resource Server.
    - while making Auth request mention `scopes`. eg: openid, profile, email, offline_access
    - returned token will have `claims`.
    
  - **Authorization Code**
    - OAuth 2 Authorization server may not directly return an Access Token.
    - Instead, and for better security, an Authorization Code may be returned, which is then exchanged for an Access Token.
  - **Grant Types** 
    - grants are the `set of steps` a Client has to perform to get "resource-access-authorization".
    - check below for detail.
  - **claims**
    - Registered claims:  iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience),
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1
    - public claims : https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml
    - private claims :

## Grant Types (flows)
- grants are the "set of steps" a Client has to perform to get "resource-access-authorization".

### `Authorization Code` Grant  with/without PKCE
- https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app-redirect/spring-boot/main/
- After validating client identity,
- AuthServer return single-use Authorization-Code to the Client via callback URI
- which is then exchanged for an Access Token.
- use-case : Traditional web apps where the exchange can `securely` happen on the server side. // back-channel.
- **PKCE** : additional steps that make it more secure for mobile/native apps and SPAs.
```
    1. Client : GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=`CLIENT_ID`&redirect_uri=`REDIRECT_URI`&scope=read&state=xyz
    2. OKTA : HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location: https://client-app.com/callback?code=`AUTHORIZATION_CODE`&state=xyz
    3. Client : POST /token 
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
       grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
```

### `Implicit` Grant
- A simplified flow where the Access Token is returned "directly" to the Client.
- use-case : SPA.

### `client-credential` Grant
- First client acquire its own credentials(client id, client secret) from the Authorization Server,
- Access Token is returned against these credential. (basically AuthServer validate identity.)
- use-case : lambda, micro services.
- https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/05/05/client-credentials-spring-security
- make api call in postman (POST) :
  - url : https://your-okta-domain/oauth2/default/v1/token
  - body: 
    - grant_type: client_credentials
    - scope: <your-scope>
    - **DPoP** : ??
  - Authorization : basic auth
    - Username: Your Client ID
    - Password: Your Client Secret
- got exception: :small_red_trinagle:
  - org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.OAuth2AuthorizationException: [invalid_dpop_proof] The **DPoP proof JWT header is missing**. 
  - Demonstration of Proof of Possession
  - provides an additional layer of security by requiring the client to prove possession of a private key associated.
  - Disable it of Authorizarion-server 

### `Refresh Token` Grant
- involves the exchange of a Refresh Token for a new Access Token.
